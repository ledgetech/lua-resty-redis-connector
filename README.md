# lua-resty-redis-connector

[![Build
Status](https://travis-ci.org/ledgetech/lua-resty-redis-connector.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ledgetech/lua-resty-redis-connector)

Connection utilities for
[lua-resty-redis](https://github.com/openresty/lua-resty-redis), making it easy
and reliable to connect to Redis hosts, either directly or via [Redis
Sentinel](http://redis.io/topics/sentinel).


## Synopsis

Quick and simple authenticated connection on localhost to DB 2:

```lua
local redis, err = require("resty.redis.connector").new({
    url = "redis://PASSWORD@127.0.0.1:6379/2",
}):connect()
```

More verbose configuration, with timeouts and a default password:

```lua
local rc = require("resty.redis.connector").new({
    connect_timeout = 50,
    send_timeout = 5000,
    read_timeout = 5000,
    keepalive_timeout = 30000,
    password = "mypass",
})

local redis, err = rc:connect({
    url = "redis://127.0.0.1:6379/2",
})

-- ...

local ok, err = rc:set_keepalive(redis)  -- uses keepalive params
```

Keep all config in a table, to easily create / close connections as needed:

```lua
local rc = require("resty.redis.connector").new({
    connect_timeout = 50,
    send_timeout = 5000,
    read_timeout = 5000,
    keepalive_timeout = 30000,

    host = "127.0.0.1",
    port = 6379,
    db = 2,
    password = "mypass",
})

local redis, err = rc:connect()

-- ...

local ok, err = rc:set_keepalive(redis)
```

[connect](#connect) can be used to override some defaults given in [new](#new),
which are pertinent to this connection only.


```lua
local rc = require("resty.redis.connector").new({
    host = "127.0.0.1",
    port = 6379,
    db = 2,
})

local redis, err = rc:connect({
    db = 5,
})
```


## DSN format

If the `params.url` field is present then it will be parsed to set the other
params. Any manually specified params will override values given in the DSN.

*Note: this is a behaviour change as of v0.06. Previously, the DSN values would
take precedence.*

### Direct Redis connections

The format for connecting directly to Redis is:

`redis://USERNAME:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DB`

The `USERNAME`, `PASSWORD` and `DB` fields are optional, all other components
are required.

Use of username requires Redis 6.0.0 or newer.

### Connections via Redis Sentinel

When connecting via Redis Sentinel, the format is as follows:

`sentinel://USERNAME:PASSWORD@MASTER_NAME:ROLE/DB`

Again, `USERNAME`, `PASSWORD` and `DB` are optional. `ROLE` must be either `m`
or `s` for master / slave respectively.

On versions of Redis newer than 5.0.1, Sentinels can optionally require their
own password. If enabled, provide this password in the `sentinel_password`
parameter. On Redis 6.2.0 and newer you can pass username using
`sentinel_username` parameter.

A table of `sentinels` must also be supplied. e.g.

```lua
local redis, err = rc:connect{
    url = "sentinel://mymaster:a/2",
    sentinels = {
        { host = "127.0.0.1", port = 26379 },
    },
    sentinel_username = "default",
    sentinel_password = "password"
}
```

## Proxy Mode

Enable the `connection_is_proxied` parameter if connecting to Redis through a
proxy service (e.g. Twemproxy). These proxies generally only support a limited
sub-set of Redis commands, those which do not require state and do not affect
multiple keys. Databases and transactions are also not supported.

Proxy mode will disable switching to a DB on connect. Unsupported commands
(defaults to those not supported by Twemproxy) will return `nil, err`
immediately rather than being sent to the proxy, which can result in dropped
connections.

`discard` will not be sent when adding connections to the keepalive pool


## Disabled commands

If configured as a table of commands, the command methods will be replaced by a
function which immediately returns `nil, err` without forwarding the command to
the server

## Default Parameters


```lua
{
    connect_timeout = 100,
    send_timeout = 1000,
    read_timeout = 1000,
    keepalive_timeout = 60000,
    keepalive_poolsize = 30,

    -- ssl, ssl_verify, server_name, pool, pool_size, backlog
    -- see: https://github.com/openresty/lua-resty-redis#connect
    connection_options = {},

    host = "127.0.0.1",
    port = "6379",
    path = "",  -- unix socket path, e.g. /tmp/redis.sock
    username = "",
    password = "",
    sentinel_username = "",
    sentinel_password = "",
    db = 0,

    master_name = "mymaster",
    role = "master",  -- master | slave
    sentinels = {},

    connection_is_proxied = false,

    disabled_commands = {},
}
```


## API

* [new](#new)
* [connect](#connect)
* [set_keepalive](#set_keepalive)
* [Utilities](#utilities)
    * [connect_via_sentinel](#connect_via_sentinel)
    * [try_hosts](#try_hosts)
    * [connect_to_host](#connect_to_host)
    * [sentinel.get_master](#sentinelget_master)
    * [sentinel.get_slaves](#sentinelget_slaves)


### new

`syntax: rc = redis_connector.new(params)`

Creates the Redis Connector object, overriding default params with the ones given.
In case of failures, returns `nil` and a string describing the error.


### connect

`syntax: redis, err = rc:connect(params)`

Attempts to create a connection, according to the `params` supplied, falling back
to [defaults](#default-parameters) given in `new` or the predefined defaults. If
a connection cannot be made, returns `nil` and a string describing the reason.

Note that `params` given here do not change the connector's own configuration,
and are only used to alter this particular connection operation. As such, the
following parameters have no meaning when given in `connect`.

* `keepalive_poolsize`
* `keepalive_timeout`
* `connection_is_proxied`
* `disabled_commands`


### set_keepalive

`syntax: ok, err = rc:set_keepalive(redis)`

Attempts to place the given Redis connection on the keepalive pool, according to
timeout and poolsize params given in `new` or the predefined defaults.

This allows an application to release resources without having to keep track of
application wide keepalive settings.

Returns `1` or in the case of error, `nil` and a string describing the error.


## Utilities

The following methods are not typically needed, but may be useful if a custom
interface is required.


### connect_via_sentinel

`syntax: redis, err = rc:connect_via_sentinel(params)`

Returns a Redis connection by first accessing a sentinel as supplied by the
`params.sentinels` table, and querying this with the `params.master_name` and
`params.role`.


### try_hosts

`syntax: redis, err = rc:try_hosts(hosts)`

Tries the hosts supplied in order and returns the first successful connection.


### connect_to_host

`syntax: redis, err = rc:connect_to_host(host)`

Attempts to connect to the supplied `host`.


### sentinel.get_master

`syntax: master, err = sentinel.get_master(sentinel, master_name)`

Given a connected Sentinel instance and a master name, will return the current
master Redis instance.


### sentinel.get_slaves

`syntax: slaves, err = sentinel.get_slaves(sentinel, master_name)`

Given a connected Sentinel instance and a master name, will return a list of
registered slave Redis instances.
